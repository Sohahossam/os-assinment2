1. Code examples from Lab-5 (all codes and expalanations in readme)
   • process_creation.c      → demonstrates the fork() system call
   • file1.c + file2.c       → demonstrates the role of the LINKER
   • simple_program.c        → demonstrates the role of the LOADER (used with ldd)

2. What the fork() example does
   The program calls fork() which creates a child process.
   Return value of fork():
   - 0      → we are inside the child process
   - >0     → we are inside the parent process (value = child PID)
   - -1     → fork failed
   Both parent and child print their own messages.

3. Job of the Linker
  A linker is a system program that runs after compilation and its job is to combine different pieces of code into a single executable.
it combines multiple object files and libraries into one final executable.and also Joins object files


4. Job of the Loader
A loader is part of the operating system that loads the executable into memory and starts its execution.Loads the program from disk to RAM
and Allocates memory and also relocate.and Starts running the program
