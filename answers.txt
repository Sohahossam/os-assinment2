1. Code examples from Lab-5 (all implemented and working)
   • process_creation.c      → demonstrates the fork() system call
   • file1.c + file2.c       → demonstrates the role of the LINKER
   • simple_program.c        → demonstrates the role of the LOADER (used with ldd)

2. What the fork() example does
   The program calls fork() which creates a child process.
   Return value of fork():
   - 0      → we are inside the child process
   - >0     → we are inside the parent process (value = child PID)
   - -1     → fork failed
   Both parent and child print their own messages.

3. Job of the Linker
   The linker combines multiple object files and resolves external references.
   In the example:
   - file1.c contains the definition of hello()
   - file2.c only declares and calls hello()
   When we run: gcc file1.c file2.c -o linker_example
   → The linker connects the call in file2.c to the actual code in file1.c

4. Job of the Loader
   When we execute a program (./simple_program), the loader
   Loads the executable into memory ,Loads required shared libraries (shown by ldd simple_program)
   ,Performs dynamic linking and address relocation
    ,Starts program execution from main()

5. Makefile
   The provided Makefile compiles all three examples correctly:
   - make            → builds process_creation, linker_example, simple_program
   - make run        → runs all programs and shows ldd output

Screenshots of compilation and execution are included in the repository.
All programs were compiled and tested on Ubuntu (WSL).
